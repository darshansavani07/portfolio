            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Darshan Savani </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Surat Gujarat, India.</span>
            <br />I have done my B.Tech from marwadi university in the field of I.T(2018-2022) it self.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
            I have over 1.5+ years of Front End Developer experience ✏️ working with technologies like:
            ✅ <span className="purple">HTML | CSS | React | Javascript | Typescript | Bootstrap | MUI | Antd | Figma</span> <br /> <br />
            I can build you a custom website solution using REST APIs or even make a React ⚛️ powered front end with CMS backend so your team can modify some content on the page without a developer's help.
            <br /> <br />
            So many possibilities, I can say so much. But maybe it's best that you start off by telling me what you need help in. How can I help? :-)
            <br />

            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
